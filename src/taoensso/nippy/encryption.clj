  Password form [:salted \"my-password\"]
  ---------------------------------------
  USE CASE: You want more than a small, finite number of passwords (e.g. each
            item encrypted will use a unique user-provided password).

  IMPLEMENTATION: Uses a relatively cheap key hash, but automatically salts
                  every key.

  PROS: Each key is independent so would need to be attacked independently.
  CONS: Key caching impossible, so there's an inherent trade-off between
        encryption/decryption speed and the difficulty of attacking any
        particular key.

  Slower than `aes128-cached`, and easier to attack any particular key - but
  keys are independent.

  Password form [:cached \"my-password\"]
  ---------------------------------------
  USE CASE: You want only a small, finite number of passwords (e.g. a limited
            number of staff/admins, or you'll be using a single password to
            encrypt many items).

  IMPLEMENTATION: Uses a _very_ expensive (but cached) key hash, and no salt.

  PROS: Great amortized encryption/decryption speed. Expensive key hash makes
        attacking any particular key very difficult.
  CONS: Using a small number of keys for many encrypted items means that if any
        key _is_ somehow compromised, _all_ items encrypted with that key are
        compromised.

  Faster than `aes128-salted`, and harder to attack any particular key - but
  increased danger if a key is somehow compromised."
